# Airbnb-Analysis 

Overview:

This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The objectives include establishing a MongoDB connection, retrieving the Airbnb dataset efficiently, cleaning and preparing the dataset, developing a streamlit web application with interactive maps, conducting price analysis and visualization, analyzing availability patterns, investigating location-based insights, creating interactive visualizations, and building a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI.

Problem Statement:

The Airbnb Data Analysis project addresses the following key areas:

Establishing a MongoDB connection and retrieving the Airbnb dataset.
Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Developing a streamlit web application with interactive maps.
Conducting price analysis and visualization.
Analyzing availability patterns across seasons.
Investigating location-based insights.
Creating interactive visualizations.
Building a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI.
Data
MongoDB Atlas is used for data storage and retrieval. The process involves creating a MongoDB Atlas account, setting up a cluster, loading the Airbnb sample data, and importing it into the cluster.

Approach:

MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval: Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types.
Geospatial Visualization: Develop a streamlit web application for interactive maps showcasing Airbnb listings' distribution.
Price Analysis and Visualization: Analyze price variations across locations, property types, and seasons using dynamic plots.
Availability Analysis by Season: Analyze Airbnb listing availability based on seasonal variations.
Location-Based Insights: Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.
Interactive Visualizations: Develop interactive visualizations allowing users to filter and drill down into the data.
Dashboard Creation: Create a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI to present key insights from the analysis.
